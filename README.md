- About AES_128: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that is widely used across the globe to secure data. AES-128 refers specifically to the version of AES that uses a 128-bit key for encryption and decryption.
--------------------------------------------------
- This is a project we designed for SoC class
It's an AES_128 module with Avalon IP Interface
